# This simulator was designed to predict the hemolysis phenomenoun in the CAMP test(a classical microbiology test for detecting Group B Streptococcus). 
# According to the known hemolysis and biological features of S.a and GBS, we made three assumptions:
# 1. It was CAMP factor that caused hemolysis, not β-lysin. β-lysin just enhanced the collapse of SRBC membrane.
# 2. Decompostion of the sphingolipids by β-lysin in SRBC membrane was the prerequsity of enhanced hemolysis.
# 3. The reaction between β-lyzed SRBC and CAMP factor was proportional and specifical, in other words, what happend here was like reaction between antibody and antigen.
# 
# So, it was clear that CAMP test should have shore a similar mode with DID(double Immuno Diffusion test).
# However，CAMP test will not reflect the reaction directly with "Immunoprecipitation" liked stuffs, instead, CAMP test can merely depict the hemolysis of SRBC.
# That is the reason why CAMP test was half-different with DID on the one side but half matched on the other side.
